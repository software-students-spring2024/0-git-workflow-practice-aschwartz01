**[Exploring AI and Generative AI Automation](https://www.blueprism.com/guides/ai-automation/#:~:text=By%20incorporating%20AI%20into%20RPA,improve%20its%20performance%20over%20time.)**<br>
The article I chose discusses the use of AI in automation and how it can be used in different sectors of the workforce. I find this extremely interesting as I have been working in the financial sector for quite some time, and I see the need to be able to automate complex tasks that would often be too difficult to program without AI. I have written some programs to automate tasks in the past, but some tasks, such as validating invoices, have been too complex to do without the use of AI. However, with the use of Intelligent document processing (or IDP), the validation and settlement of those invoices become possible. This would give companies the ability to get rid of entire teams that focus on manual settlements, thus reducing costs, as AI would be able to take on that role with little human interaction.

#### Minjae's comment
It is interesting to see how AI can be applied to many different industries to lower costs and increase efficiency.
